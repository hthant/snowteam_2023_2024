This is the math that goes over the way I calculated the resolution needed based on how many pixels would be on the object. Pixels in the x and y direction calculated seperately.

Also goes through the fps math but not as necessary.

The 2nd page goes over the total bytes these cameras produce if we have 8 of them running at 22fps and has a resoltuino of 12MP.
