Snowflake Team Project Files AY2023_2024

### Summary
  The Machine Learning, Sensing, and Image Processing for Snow Research Senior Design team (Snowflake team) is first repairing the snow measurement and analysis system (SMAS). The SMAS is a device that gathers information on snowflakes and analyzes them using machine learning. This gathers important data including the fall speed of the snowflake and its approximate mass, volume, and density while a snowflake is actively falling. This is accomplished through the high-speed cameras and flashes that are triggered through a system of laser sensors. This data needs to be collected outdoors in harsh winter conditions, so the device must be waterproof and operate at very cold temperatures. This also brings up electrical issues such as providing it with a constant power supply and internet so it continually collects and analyzes data from winter storms. As this is an ongoing project, there is an existing device that is being repaired and improved on from previous years. Additionally, the team is planning the next generation of the SMAS that will be an improvement on the current version. This improvement mainly focuses on a better mechanical design to increase the accuracy of fall speed measurements, as well as improvements on electrical and computer hardware.

### Fall 2023 Semester Goals
- **Noah Johnson:**
- **Connor Mackell:**
- **Kyle Nilsson:**
- **Lauren Rickert:** *My goals this semester include designing, 3D printing, and running computational fluid dynamics models and anlyses. I am hoping to come up with a better design for a future eneration of the snow device. This design would decrease the turbulence inside of the chamber, decrease the seperation of flow on the inlet of the chamber, as well as decrease inlet of flow from the bottom of the chamber. This design should also be producable with the tools and machines here at CSU. Another thing that I am deisingning is a pen that has an LED light at the end.This will be used as a tool to callibrate the cameras in the device. Another goal for this semster is to learn how to use the resin printers in the I2P lab and print snowflakes in order to help with 3D reconstruction of the snwoflakes caught in the cameras when the device is deployed.*
