# Snowteam 2023/2024
Snowflake Team Project Files AY2023_2024

### Summary
  The Machine Learning, Sensing, and Image Processing for Snow Research Senior Design team (Snowflake team) is first repairing the snow measurement and analysis system (SMAS). The SMAS is a device that gathers information on snowflakes and analyzes them using machine learning. This gathers important data including the fall speed of the snowflake and its approximate mass, volume, and density while a snowflake is actively falling. This is accomplished through the high-speed cameras and flashes that are triggered through a system of laser sensors. This data needs to be collected outdoors in harsh winter conditions, so the device must be waterproof and operate at very cold temperatures. This also brings up electrical issues such as providing it with a constant power supply and internet so it continually collects and analyzes data from winter storms. As this is an ongoing project, there is an existing device that is being repaired and improved on from previous years. Additionally, the team is planning the next generation of the SMAS that will be an improvement on the current version. This improvement mainly focuses on a better mechanical design to increase the accuracy of fall speed measurements, as well as improvements on electrical and computer hardware.
